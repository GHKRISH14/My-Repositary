Requirement:
Write a crypto feed: a web server that returns crypto quotes on demand scraped/API’d 
from an exchange (his choice).Single Java executable, no databases.

Analysis:
As per my understanding, i need to create a java project with some java files and a 
service file that returns crypto quotes on demand.
-I am not supposed to use any database.
-To get the data from server i have used Rest(Service) with help of third party API's and JARS 


In order to execute these files in your system you need to provide API KEY which i
have uploaded by using seperate file in GITHUB with name API KEY.
